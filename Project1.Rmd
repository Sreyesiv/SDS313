# **Introduction**
This dataset includes statistics about skyscrapers in the US.

Variables include the name, the city, the materials used, the height (in meters), and more.

The data was sourced from the [Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat](https://www.ctbuh.org/) (formerly known as The Skyscraper Center).

In this report, we will be investigating three predictor variables (material, 
floors, and height) and their relationship to the outcome variable (years to 
build a skyscraper).

# **Distribution and Statistics of Years to Build a Skyscraper**
```{r echo = FALSE}
skyscraper <- read.csv("Project1_skyscrapers.csv")
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
boxplot(skyscraper$YearsToBuild, horizontal = TRUE, 
        main = "Boxplot of Years to Build a Skyscraper", xlab = "Years")

hist(skyscraper$YearsToBuild, breaks = 20, main = "Histogram of Years to Build a Skyscraper",
     xlab = "Years")
```

As we can see from the boxplot and histogram, the distribution of the years it 
took to build a skyscraper is heavily skewed right with a five-number summary 
of `r fivenum(skyscraper$YearsToBuild)` (minimum, lower quartile, median, upper 
quartile, and maximum respectively).

# **Relationships between Predictor Variables and Outcome Variable**
For each predictor variable, we will create a relevant graph that shows its 
relationship with the outcome variable and calculate any relevant bivariate 
statistics.

### **1. Material Used to Build Each Skyscraper**
```{r echo = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

ssplot <- ggplot(skyscraper)

ssplot + geom_boxplot(aes(x = YearsToBuild, y = Material)) + 
  labs(title = "Boxplots of Years to Build a Skyscraper by Material", 
       x = "Years")
```

From the boxplots, it appears that the skyscrapers built from steel, concrete, 
and composite material have a significant amount of outliers when compared to 
that of skyscapers built with masonry and concrete/steel.

This may suggest that the mean of years it took for skyscapers to be built from 
steel, concrete and composite material could potentially be higher than that of 
skyscapers built with masonry, and concrete/steel materials.

```{r echo = FALSE}
library(kableExtra)

materialAggregate <- aggregate(YearsToBuild~Material, data = skyscraper, 
                               FUN = median)
materialAggregate$MeanYearsToBuild <- round(c(
  mean(skyscraper$YearsToBuild[skyscraper$Material == "steel"]),
  mean(skyscraper$YearsToBuild[skyscraper$Material == "masonry"]),
  mean(skyscraper$YearsToBuild[skyscraper$Material == "concrete/steel"]),
  mean(skyscraper$YearsToBuild[skyscraper$Material == "concrete"]),
  mean(skyscraper$YearsToBuild[skyscraper$Material == "composite"])
), 2)

kbl(materialAggregate, col.names = 
      c("Materials", "Median of Years to Build Skyscraper", 
        "Mean of Years to Build Skyscraper")) %>% kable_styling()
```

However, when looking at the table, we can see that there is a minimal spread between both the median and mean. The median only differs by `r max(materialAggregate$YearsToBuild) - min(materialAggregate$YearsToBuild)` and the mean only differs by a max of `r max(materialAggregate$MeanYearsToBuild) - min(materialAggregate$MeanYearsToBuild)`.

From this, we can most likely conclude that the material has no effect on the number of years it takes for a skyscraper to be built.

### **2. Floors of Each Skyscraper Built**
```{r echo = FALSE}
plot(skyscraper$YearsToBuild, skyscraper$Floors, 
     main = "Years to Build a Skyscraper & Number of Floors", 
     xlab = "Years", ylab = "Floors", pch = 20)
```

From the graph, we can see a majority of plots plotted within 1-4 on the x-axis
and about 5-60 on the y-axis, making it hard to see a line of best fit. The 
correlation of the scatterplot, `r round(cor(skyscraper$YearsToBuild, 
skyscraper$Floors), 2)`, is positive, but also very weak.

From this, we can most likely conclude that the number of floors on skyscraper
has no effect on the number of years it takes for a skyscraper to be built.

### **3. Height of Each Skyscraper Built (in meters)**
```{r echo = FALSE}
plot(skyscraper$YearsToBuild, skyscraper$Height,  
     main = "Years to Build a Skyscraper & Height", 
     xlab = "Years", ylab = "Height (in meters)", pch = 20)
```

Compared to the last scatterplot, this one seems to show a stronger correlation 
than that between years and number of floors. However, similarly to the last 
one, the outliers make it difficult to make out a line of best fit. Although 
the correlation of `r round(cor(skyscraper$YearsToBuild, skyscraper$Height), 2)`
is stronger than that between years and number of floors, it is still quite too
weak to establish a strong correlation between the two variables.

# **Conclusion**
Although it is reasonable to believe that the three separate variables 
(material, number of floors, and height) would have some sort of effect on the
years it would take for a skyscraper to be built, we have found that there is
not strong enough evidence to conclude that.

### **Main Takeaways:**
1. Material used: Difference in both mean and median are too small to be 
considered significant.

2. Number of floors: Correlation is too weak to be considered significant.

3. Height (in meters): Correlation is too weak to be considered significant.

### **Suggestions for Future Research**
Some other areas to explore that could effect the time it takes to build a skyscraper could include: construction company, total cost of project,
climate, total number of workers, etc.
